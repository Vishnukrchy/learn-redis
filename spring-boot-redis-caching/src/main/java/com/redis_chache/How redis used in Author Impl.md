# What is @Cacheable and Why Do We Use It?
‚öôÔ∏è Purpose:
@Cacheable tells Spring:
‚ÄúYo, if this method gets called with the same input again, don‚Äôt go to the DB ‚Äî just return the cached value.‚Äù
‚úÖ Why we use it?
Avoid repeating DB hits for the same data
Reduce response time
Improve performance & scalability
# How Redis is Used in Author Implementation
```java
@Cacheable(value = "authors", key = "#id")
public Author getAuthorById(Long id) {
    // Simulate a database call
    return authorRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
}
```
In this example, when `getAuthorById` is called with a specific `id`, Spring checks if the result is already cached under the key "authors::id". If it is, it returns the cached value. If not, it executes the method, retrieves the author from the database, and caches the result for future calls.

üß† What‚Äôs value?
It‚Äôs the cache name ‚Äî think of it as a map/table stored in Redis.
"authors" becomes the name of your Redis cache bucket
üß† What‚Äôs key = "#id"?
This means use the method‚Äôs argument id as the Redis key
So if id = 5, Redis key will be: authors::5
#  Example Flow
1. **First Call**: `getAuthorById(5)`
   - Cache miss
   - Calls the database
   - Caches result under key "authors::5"
   - Returns the author object
   - Cache now has "authors::5" with the author data
2. **Subsequent Call**: `getAuthorById(5)`
   - Cache hit
   - Returns the cached author object
   - No database call needed
   - Cache remains unchanged

#üß™ How to Verify if Caching Works
1. **Check Redis**: Use a Redis client or CLI to see if the key "authors::5" exists after the first call.
2. **Logs**: Add logging in your method to see if it‚Äôs being executed or if it‚Äôs returning from cache.
3. ‚úÖ 2. Use Redis CLI to See Keys

> KEYS *
> KEYS authors:*  # This will show all keys starting with "authors:"
> "authors::10"
  
3. # Spring Boot Actuator
   - If you have Actuator enabled, you can check the cache metrics to see hits and misses.
   - You can access the cache information via `/actuator/caches` endpoint.
   - This will show you the cache names, sizes, and hit/miss statistics.
   - This is useful for monitoring cache performance and ensuring that caching is working as expected.
   - # Redis Cache in Spring Boot
# fOR  Logging its enabled in application.properties
[]: # logging.level.org.springframework.cache=DEBUG
[]: # This will log cache hits and misses, allowing you to see when the cache is being used.
# we can used loging in service class like this:
```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
@Service
public class AuthorService {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AuthorService.class);

    @Cacheable(value = "authors", key = "#id")
    public Author getAuthorById(Long id) {
        logger.debug("Fetching author  form db with id : {}", id);
        // Simulate a database call
        return authorRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
    }
}
```
3. # Use RedisInsight GUI (optional)
   It‚Äôs a GUI tool to view keys/values in Redis easily:
Shows all cached keys

You can even manually delete or inspect them

üîÅ When Cache Gets Removed or Updated?
Action	Annotation	Purpose
Read (first time)	@Cacheable	Adds to cache
Update the entity	@CachePut	Updates cache with new value
Delete the entity	@CacheEvict	Removes it from cache

# Tips
# Always use a unique key (like id) to avoid clashes
You can cache custom keys like this:
```java
@Cacheable(value = "authors", key = "#author.name")
public Author getAuthorByName(String name) {
    // Simulate a database call
    return authorRepository.findByName(name).orElse(null);
}
@Cacheable(value = "authors", key = "'email:' + #author.email")

```
You can also cache based on multiple params:
```java
@Cacheable(value = "authors", key = "#author.name + ':' + #author.country")
public Author getAuthorByNameAndCountry(String name, String country) {
    // Simulate a database call
    return authorRepository.findByNameAndCountry(name, country).orElse(null);
}
@Cacheable(value = "authorDetails", key = "#id + '-' + #status")

```
